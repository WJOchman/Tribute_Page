      Technology is the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes, especially in industry. Technology is also
      the sum of techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the production of goods and services, or in the
      accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation.

      The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools. The prehistoric invention of shaped stone
      tools followed by the discovery of fire increased sources of food. The later Neolithic Revolution extended this and
      quadrupled the sustenance available from a territory. The invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control
      their environment.

      Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical
      barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. Technology has helped develop more
      advanced and diverse economies, including our global economy today.
