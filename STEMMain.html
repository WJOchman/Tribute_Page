        Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics are the most powerful tools humanity has at its disposal for
        understanding the natural world and controlling it to suit our greatest needs and desires.
        <br>
        <br>
        Throughout the ages of human civilisations, STEM have always been at the core of survival, progress, and prosperity.
        Scientific discovery and development have been the difference between a civilisation’s victory or destruction.
        <br>
        <br>
        From fire to nuclear energy, ancient medicines to vaccines and chemotherapy, abacus to machine learning, bows and arrows 
        to military drones, and chariots to tanks. Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics have been at the
        forefront of human development.
        <br>
        <br>
        This page is a tribute towards the Scientific Method and all the great people before us who have dedicated their lives
        to it, so that we may have a fighting chance against the perils of the Universe and a chance to achieve greater heights in the great beyond.

        “Look again at that dot. That’s here. That’s home. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard
        of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of
        confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator
        and destroyer of civilisation, every kind and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful
        child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every ‘superstar’, every ‘supreme
        leader’, every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there – on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

        The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those general and
        emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the
        endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of
        some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their
        hatreds.
        <br>
        <br>
        Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are
        challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our
        obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.
        <br>
        <br>
        The Earth is the only world known so far to harbour life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which
        our species cold migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make out
        stand.
        <br>
        <br>
        It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better
        demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our
        responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we’ve
        ever known.“
