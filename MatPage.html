    <h1>Mathematics</h1>
      <br>
    <p>
      Mathematics is the study of topics such as quantity (number theory), structure (algebra), space (geometry), and change
      (analysis). Currently, there exists no generally accepted definition for mathematics. However, it is known as The
      Language of The Universe.

      Mathematicians seek and use patterns to formulate new conjectures. They resolve the truth or falsity of such by
      mathematical proof. When mathematical structures are good models or real-world phenomena, mathematical reasoning can be
      used to provide insight or predictions about nature.

      Through the use of abstraction and logic, mathematics developed from counting, calculation, measurement, and the
      systematic study of shapes and motions of physical objects. Practical mathematics have been a human activity from as far
      back as written records exist.

      Mathematics arose from a variety of different problems. At first these were found in commerce, land measurement,
      architecture, and later astronomy. Today, all sciences use mathematics to aid with the understanding and manipulation of
      nature.
