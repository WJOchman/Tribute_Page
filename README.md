This project is the first required project for the "Responsive Web Design" certification which is offered by freeCodeCamp.org.
The purpose of this project is to build a tribute page using HTML and CSS techniques as learned throughout the course. 
The requirements for this project can be read from the official freeCodeCamp website in the links below:

This website is a tribute page dedicated towards my love and respect for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics), and the Scientific Method.  

The website is split into a total of 7 parts:
1. Navigation Bar:
   - The Website has a fixed navigation bar, meaning that as the user scrolls throughout the website it remains in the same place at all times.
   - This is so that if the user wants to read only a specific part of the webpage, rather than scroll through the entire page, the user can simply click any of the categories presented in the navigation bar and the website will taken them straight to that desired section.

2. Introduction:
   - This section is the introduction of what the website is about. It is a very simple piece of text in horizontal alignment with a picture related to the topic of the section. 

3. Science:
   - This section is all about the introduction of Science. The structure of this section is the same as of the Introduction. A simple piece of text in horizontal alignment with a picture related to the topic of the section. However, the picture and piece of text have switched order in comparison to the previous section.
   
4. Technology:
   - This section introduces the user to the topic of Technology. The structure of this section is exactly the same as that of the Introduction section of the webpage.

5. Engineering:
   - This section introduces the user to the topic of Engineering. The structure of this section is exactly the same as that of the Science section of the webpage. 

6. Mathematics:
   - This section introduces the user to the topic of Mathematics. The structure of this section is exactly the same as that of the Introduction section of the webpage.

7. Footer:
   - This section is just an invitation for the user to explore the social media accounts of the creator of this website - Wojciech J Ochman.

The styling of this website is also very basic, the color theme is a mixture of dark grays, alternating between lighter and darker gray for each section, with lightgray font color. The navigation bar has the darkest background color along with the lighters font color (white). The footer also contains the lighters font color (white).

I have no rights over the images used in this project, they have been found via a Google Search.
However, this work has been an individual project and I can confirm that this work has not been copied.

This project has been completed on the 3rd of September 2021.
