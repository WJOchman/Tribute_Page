# TributeWebsite

This is a Front-End portfolio project which demonstrates a tribute webpage dedicated towards STEM and the Scientific Method.

The purpose of this project is to create a Tribute Page using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This Tribute Page will be about my love and respect for STEM and the Scientific Method. Why I believe it is the gratest intellectual framework and best method for determining how our universe works, which could be used to improve our quality of life. **This is an individual project.**

<h3>HTML Structure:</h3>
  - There will be a main page talking about STEM and the Scientific Method in a general manner:
    - The main page will then contain a navigation menu which will allow the user to further explore other pages of the website
  - Other pages: (These pages will specify for each component of STEM):
  - There will only be one page, this page will contain:
  
    - The Title
    - Navigation bar which will remain static as the user scrolls down the page.
      - The navigation bar will also highlight at what section the user is
      - The navigation bar will scroll down to the section which the user clicks on the read
    - The main 'slide'
    - Carl Sagan Quote
    - Science
      - And about Science, such as Biology, Chemistry, Physics and the Scientific Method
    - Technology
    - Engineering
    - Mathematics


 <h1>The following present some more details about what each 'slide' will contain:</h1>
