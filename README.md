# TributeWebsite

The purpose of this project is to create a Tribute Page using HTML and CSS. This Tirbute Page will be about my love and respect for STEM and the Scientific Method. Why I believe it is the gratest framework and best method for determining how our world works in the way that it does. **This is an individual project.**

  - There might be a chance of JavaScript being used for some basic interactivity, but that's something to think about later

<h3>HTML Structure:</h3>

    - The main page will then contain a navigation menu which will allow the user to further explore other pages of the website
  - Other pages: (These pages will specify for each component of STEM):
  
    - Main Page:
      - The main page will set the theme for STEM, introducing the user to what it is
      - Will contain a Carl Sagan quote from _Pale Blue Dot_, 1994
      - Will allow the user to click on "Science", "Technology", "Engineering", and "Mathematics" and be taken to their own specific page
  
    - Science:
      - Will have one background image related to Science
