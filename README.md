# TributePage

The purpose of this project is to create a Tribute Page using HTML and CSS. This Tirbute Page will be about my love and respect for STEM and the Scientific Method. Why I believe it is the gratest framework and best method for determining how our world works in the way that it does. 

  - There might be a chance of JavaScript being used for some basic interactivity, but that's something to think about later

<h3>HTML Structure:</h3>
  - There will be a main page talking about STEM and the Scientific Method in a general manner:
    - The main page will then contain a navigation menu which will allow the user to further explore other pages of the website
  - Other pages: (These pages will specify for each component of STEM)
    - Science:
