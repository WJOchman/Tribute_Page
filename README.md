This project is the first required project for the "Responsive Web Design" certification which is offered by freeCodeCamp.org.
The purpose of this project is to build a tribute page using HTML and CSS techniques as learned throughout the course. 
The requirements for this project can be read from the official freeCodeCamp website in the links below:

This website is a tribute page dedicated towards my love and respect for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics), and the Scientific Method.  

The website is split into a total of 7 parts:
1. Navigation Bar:
   - The Website has a fixed navigation bar, meaning that as the user scrolls throughout the website it remains in the same place at all times.
This is so that if the user wants to read only a specific part of the webpage, rather than scroll through the entire page, the user can simply click any of the categories presented in the navigation bar and the website will taken them straight to that desired section.
