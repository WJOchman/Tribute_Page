    <h1>Science</h1>
      <br>
    <p>
      Science is an intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systemic study of the structure and behaviour of the physical and natural world through observation and experimentation. Science uses what is known as <solid>The Scientific Method</solid>, which is a procedure used to categorise and characterise the natural world for centuries. The Scientific Method consists of systematic observation, measurement, experimentation, formulation, testing, and modification of hypothesis. Hypothesis may then become Theories if enough credible evidence is collected to demonstrate the validity of the hypothesis. science is broken down into three main categories, these are Biology, Chemistry and Physics.

      <solid>Biology</solid> is a branch of science which studies and classifies living organisms, dividing them into many specialised fields which cover their morphology, physiology, anatomy, behaviour, origin, and distribution. Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection is one of many breakthroughs which have been accomplished in the field of biology!

      <br>
    <p>
      <solid>Chemistry</solid> is a branch of science which is concerned with substances of which matter is composed, the investigation of their properties and reactions, and the use of such reactions to form new substances. The Haber-Bosch process is a great example of a breakthrough in chemistry which has drastically improved human quality of life!
    </p>
      <br>
    <p>
      <solid>Physics</solid> is a branch of science which is focused on the nature and properties of matter and energy. The subject matter of physics includes mechanics, heat, light, and other radiation, sound, electricity, magnetism, and structure of atoms. Nikola Tesla's alternating current (AC) motor has transformed human lives forever!
