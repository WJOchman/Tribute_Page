    <h1>Engineering</h1>
      <br>
    <p>
      Engineering is the use of scientific principles to design and build machines, structures, and other items, including
      bridges, tunnels, roads, vehicles, and buildings. The discipline of engineering encompasses a broad range of more
      specialised fields of engineering. Every product used in your life has been engineered, from the pen and paper, chariots
      and cars, to skyscrapers and aeroplanes.

      <br>
    <p>
      <solid>Civil Engineering</solid> is the design and construction of public and private works, such as infrastructure (airports, roads,
      railways, water supply, and treatment etc.), bridges, tunnels, dams, and buildings. Civil engineering is further broken
      down into several sub-disciplines, including structural engineering, environmental engineering, and surveying.

      <br>
    <p>
      <solid>Electrical Engineering</solid> is focused on the design, study, and manufacture of various electrical and electronic systems,
      such as broadcasting, electrical circuits, generators, motors, electromagnetic/electromechanical devices, optical
      fibres, optoelectronic devices, computer systems, telecommunications, and control systems.
    </p>
      <br>
    <p>
      <solid>Mechanical Engineering</solid> is the design and manufacture of physical or mechanical systems, such as power and energy
      systems, aerospace/aircraft products, weapon systems, transportation products, engines, compressors, powertrains,
      kinematic chains, vacuum technology, vibration isolation equipment, manufacturing, robotics, turbines, audio equipment,
      and mechatronics.
    </p>
      <br>
    <p>
      <solid>Chemical Engineering</solid> is the application of physics, chemistry, biology and engineering principles in order to carry out
      chemical processes on a commercial scale, such as the manufacture of commodity chemicals, speciality chemicals,
      petroleum refining, microfabrication, fermentation, and biomolecule production.
