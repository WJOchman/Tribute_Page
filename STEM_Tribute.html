        Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics are the most powerful tools humanity has at its disposal for
        understanding the natural world and controlling it to suit our greatest needs and desires.
        Throughout the ages of human civilisations, STEM have always been at the core of survival, progress, and prosperity.
        Scientific discovery and development have been the difference between a civilisationâ€™s victory or destruction.
        <br>
        <br>
        From fire to nuclear energy, ancient medicines to vaccines and chemotherapy, abacus to machine learning, bows and arrows
        to military drones, and chariots to tanks Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics have been at the forefront
        of human development.
        This page is a tribute towards the Scientific Method and all the great people before us who have dedicated their lives
        to it, so that we may have a fighting chance against the perils of the Universe and a chance to achieve greater heights
        in the great beyond.

      <h1>Science</h1>
      <p>
        Science is an intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systemic study of the structure and behaviour of the
        physical and natural world through observation and experimentation. Science uses what is known as The Scientific Method,
        which is a procedure used to categorise and characterise the natural world for centuries. The Scientific Method consists
        of systematic observation, measurement, experimentation, formulation, testing, and modification of hypothesis.
        Hypothesis may then become Theories if enough credible evidence is collected to demonstrate the validity of the
        hypothesis. science is broken down into three main categories, these are Biology, Chemistry and Physics.
        <br>
        <br>
        Biology is a branch of science which studies and classifies living organisms, dividing them into many specialised fields
        which cover their morphology physiology, anatomy, behaviour, origin, and distribution. Theory of Evolution by Natural
        Selection is one of many breakthroughs which have been accomplished in the field of biology!
        <br>
        <br>
        Chemistry is a branch of science which is concerned with substances of which matter is composed, the investigation of
        their properties and reactions, and the use of such reactions to form new substances. The Haber-Bosch process is a great
        example of a breakthrough in chemistry which has drastically improved human quality of life!
        <br>
        <br>
        Physics is a branch of science which is focused on the nature and properties of matter and energy. The subject matter of
        physics includes mechanics, heat, light, and other radiation, sound, electricity, magnetism, and structure of atoms.
        Nikola Tesla's alternating current (AC) motor has transformed human lives forever!

    <!--- Technology --->

    <div class="Part3">
      <h1 class="TechnologyTitle">Technology</h1>
      <p>
        Technology is the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes, especially in industry. Technology is also
        the sum of techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the production of goods and services, or in the
        accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation.
        <br>
        <br>
        The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools. The prehistoric invention of shaped stone
        tools followed by the discovery of fire increased sources of food. The later Neolithic Revolution extended this and
        quadrupled the sustenance available from a territory. The invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control
        their environment.
        <br>
        <br>
        Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical
        barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. Technology has helped develop more
        advanced and diverse economies, including our global economy today.

    <!--- Engineering --->

    <div class="Part4">
      <h1 class="EngineeringTitle">Engineering</h1>
      <p>
        Engineering is the use of scientific principles to design and build machines, structures, and other items, including
        bridges, tunnels, roads, vehicles, and buildings. The discipline of engineering encompasses a broad range of more
        specialised fields of engineering. Every product used in your life has been engineered, from the pen and paper, chariots
        and cars, to skyscrapers and aeroplanes.
        <br>
        <br>
        Civil Engineering is the design and construction of public and private works, such as infrastructure (airports, roads,
        railways, water supply, and treatment etc.), bridges, tunnels, dams, and buildings. Civil engineering is further broken
        down into several sub-disciplines, including structural engineering, environmental engineering, and surveying.
        <br>
        <br>
        Electrical Engineering is focused on the design, study, and manufacture of various electrical and electronic systems,
        such as broadcasting, electrical circuits, generators, motors, electromagnetic/electromechanical devices, optical
        fibres, optoelectronic devices, computer systems, telecommunications, and control systems.
        <br>
        <br>
        Mechanical Engineering is the design and manufacture of physical or mechanical systems, such as power and energy
        systems, aerospace/aircraft products, weapon systems, transportation products, engines, compressors, powertrains,
        kinematic chains, vacuum technology, vibration isolation equipment, manufacturing, robotics, turbines, audio equipment,
        and mechatronics.
        <br>
        <br>
        Chemical Engineering is the application of physics, chemistry, biology and engineering principles in order to carry out
        chemical processes on a commercial scale, such as the manufacture of commodity chemicals, speciality chemicals,
        petroleum refining, microfabrication, fermentation, and biomolecule production.

    <!--- Mathematics --->

    <div class="Part5">
      <h1 class="MathematicsTitle">Mathematics</h1>
      <p>
        Mathematics is the study of topics such as quantity (number theory), structure (algebra), space (geometry), and change
        (analysis). Currently, there exists no generally accepted definition for mathematics. However, it is known as The
        Language of The Universe.
        <br>
        <br>
        Mathematicians seek and use patterns to formulate new conjectures. They resolve the truth or falsity of such by
        mathematical proof. When mathematical structures are good models or real-world phenomena, mathematical reasoning can be
        used to provide insight or predictions about nature.
        <br>
        <br>
        Through the use of abstraction and logic, mathematics developed from counting, calculation, measurement, and the
        systematic study of shapes and motions of physical objects. Practical mathematics have been a human activity from as far
        back as written records exist.
        <br>
        <br>
        Mathematics arose from a variety of different problems. At first these were found in commerce, land measurement,
        architecture, and later astronomy. Today, all sciences use mathematics to aid with the understanding and manipulation of
        nature.
